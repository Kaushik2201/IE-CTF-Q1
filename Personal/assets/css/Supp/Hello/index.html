        I travel from England's green hills,
        To where the Spanish sun spills.
        In France, I savor wines so fine,
        Then eastward to Russia's icy shine.

    <p class="para">Italy beckons with pasta and art,
        But my journey doesn't stop, I depart.
        Across the world to India's mystic lands,
        In each of these, my presence stands.
